# n8n Automations Backup

This repository serves as a **backup** for all my [n8n](https://n8n.io/) automation workflows.  
It ensures that all automations are version-controlled, easy to restore, and can be shared or reused in future projects.

## 📌 About
- **Purpose:** Store and version-control all n8n workflows.
- **Format:** JSON files exported directly from n8n.
- **Benefit:** Enables rollback to previous workflow versions and prevents data loss.

- `.json` — contains individual automation files, each named according to its purpose.
- `README.md` — documentation for understanding and restoring automations.


## 💡 Notes
- This repository does **not** store credentials, API keys, or sensitive data — only workflow logic.
